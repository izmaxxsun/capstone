Question,Answer,,,,,
How do I know if I need a professional?,"You know you need a professional when your usual way of doing things no longer works. You may notice a disruption in your steady state: too much or too little sleep, too much or too little eating, isolation, lack of energy, inability to concentrate, irritability, using alcohol or drugs, and thinking of hurting yourself or someone else. When you experience any of those for a few weeks, or when they interfere with your life (home, work, social), it is time to reach out to a professional.",,,,,
How do I know what kind of behavioral health professional I should contact?,"When you are referred, or self-refer, to one of the clinics at WRNMMC, the person accepting the referral will have a good sense of where to get you started; for example, your symptoms may suggest seeing a psychotherapist first, or perhaps a psychiatrist.

Psychiatrist: a physician (M.D.) who has been through medical school and is board certified in psychiatry; can prescribe psychiatric medications (such as antidepressants).

Social worker: has a master's degree in social work (M.S.W.) and, in order to practice psychotherapy, is licensed to practice (L.C.S.W.C., or L.I.C.S.W., or L.C.S.W.).

Psychologist: has a doctorate in psychology (Ph.D.) and can practice psychotherapy; psychologists have further training in administering testing.

The three professions have similar training in child development, family dynamics, relationship matters, diagnosis, and treatment. Regardless of which you initially contact, seasoned professionals will steer you in the right direction if they think you might be better served with a different profession or expertise.",,,,,
What's the difference between individual and group psychotherapy?,"Individual psychotherapy (sometimes called ""one-on-one"") is where most people start therapy. It is a private setting where a person may bring up difficult or emotional issues. Group psychotherapy includes one or two psychotherapists with three or more (up to about nine) patients. The group setting allows patients to interact with another and, under the guidance of the therapist(s), explore relationship patterns. Your individual therapist may refer you to a group if it seems a good fit, or if you request to join a group. Feel free to discuss the possibility with your therapist. ",,,,,
What is triage?,"Triage is the process used to determine how soon you need treatment based on the severity of your illness or injury. Triage allows the most seriously ill or injured patients to be treated first. Triage begins at the check-in window. NOTE: Due to the triage process, we cannot estimate the length of your stay. We appreciate your understanding and patience.

NOTE: If your PCM wants to be contacted during treatment, please understand that this can only take place AFTER your consultation with an ED physician.",,,,,
What is the fast track?,"The Fast Track is a division of the ED that specializes in treating urgent care concerns. Urgent care is typically less complex than emergency care, and usually takes less time. When your condition is not life-threatening but requires treatment within 24 hours, you need urgent care. Examples of urgent care concerns are:

sprains/strains

minor trauma/burns

neck/back pain

asthma/upper respiratory conditions

skin rashes

bug bites",,,,,
Why do I keep repeating myself?,"Your safety is our priority. Repeating your name, symptoms and circumstances to multiple staff members helps us uncover important and helpful details about your condition. Be involved. Use these opportunities to ask questions. If something doesn’t “sound right,” please speak up and let us know!",,,,,
Why am I waiting?,"Wait times are affected by the number of our patients and the severity of their illnesses or injuries. Tests or consults can also affect wait times. In fact, some tests require periods of fasting so please do not eat or drink anything while you wait unless you have permission from a doctor or nurse.

NOTE: For the safety and privacy of all patients, please wait in your treatment room and try not to spend time in the hallways or other common areas.",,,,,
Can you treat my pain?,"We want you to be as comfortable as possible. Common pain therapies include acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, trans-dermal medication patches, hot/cold compresses and splints. We avoid using opioids (narcotics) whenever possible. If an opioid is required for effective pain control, only the lowest effective dose is used.

NOTE: You may not be able to drive for up to six hours after receiving certain pain medications.",,,,,
Why am I not getting antibiotics?,"Antibiotics only work on bacterial infections. Common conditions like colds, sinus and respiratory infections are usually viral infections and will not respond to antibiotics. In fact, taking antibiotics when they’re not necessary may worsen your condition. Your provider will know if antibiotics are appropriate for your diagnosis.

NOTE: Inappropriate use of antibiotics can be harmful to your health and cause your body to become immune to them in the future.",,,,,
I’m being discharged - what now?,"Once a provider has informed you of your discharge, please wait to review and sign your discharge paperwork. Please do not get dressed until given permission to do so.
We may need to contact you during the next 48 hours, so please give us the best phone number to reach you during this time. Be sure to let us know if you have any questions or concerns before you leave. Understanding your discharge plan is an important part of recovery.
NOTE: You may need an escort if you took any medications during your stay that can cause drowsiness or impairment.",,,,,
What should I do after I leave?,"Follow your discharge plan. Complete any medication therapy as prescribed. Contact your Primary Care Manager (PCM) or referring clinic as instructed. If you experience any complications, contact your PCM immediately or return to the Emergency Department.
Please provide feedback regarding your care experience at: http://go.usa.gov/x8yRd
NOTE: The Emergency Department is not a substitute for primary care. It is important for your long term health to establish and maintain a relationship with a Primary Care Manager.",,,,,
